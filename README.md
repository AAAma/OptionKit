**NOTE**: OPTIONKIT IS NOT YET READY FOR USE

OptionKit - Option Parsing in Swift
=========

OptionKit is an OS X framework to parse basic command-line options in pure Swift. It
does not currently support sub-parsers, or any more advanced features.

## Overview

OptionKit currently supports three types of options:

* Short options, triggered by flags of the type `-f` or `fab` (which triggers three flags)
* Long options, triggered by flags of the type `--long-option`
* Mixed options, triggered by either type, such as `-v` or `--version`

An option (of any type) can have zero or more required parameters. Parameters are restricted
in that they cannot being with `-` or `--`, as they would be confused with triggers.

## Examples

A simple, full example called `test.swift` might be:

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env xcrun swift -F /Library/Frameworks

import Foundation
import OptionKit

let opt1 = OptionDefinition(trigger:.Mixed("e", "echo"))
let parser = OptionParser(flags:[opt1])
 
let result = parser.parse(Process.arguments)

switch result {
case .Success(let box):
  let options = box.value
  if options[opt1] != nil {
    println("\(Process.arguments[2..<Process.arguments.count])")
  }
case .Failure(let err):
  println(err)
}
```

The output would be:

```
~: ./test.swift -e hello
[hello]
~: ./test.swift hello
~: ./test.swift --echo hello world
[hello world]
~: ./test.swift -e
~: ./test.swift -r
Invalid option: -r
```

## Missing (Potential) Features

* A good return type for the parsing. Currently, the parser returns a dictionary of optionsâ€”but that isn't enough, since it does not return the remainder of the parameters, or the number of parameters consumed by the parser.
* Support for closure-based configuration. Ruby's OptParse allows options to be defined with closures that are called when triggered. This is somewhat difficult with the strong typing requirements of Swift, but is worth considering.
